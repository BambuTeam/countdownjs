            I wish to participate in The VERTIKALITY TRAIL CAMP (Event) and if applicable to my registration. I verify that I have full knowledge of the rigors and risk involved in participation in the Event(s), including the physical challenge of both short and long distance runs I have chosen, and I understand, that running can be a dangerous sport. I am voluntarily participating in the Event(s) with knowledge of the dangers involved, including without limitation, the risks of death, disability, injury, loss, damages, the unavailability of medical care, or the NEGLIGENCE or deliberate act of another person and I agree to accept any and all risks of injury, damage or death. I understand that by participating in the Event(s), I will be using public and private lands and facilities where many hazards exist, and I am aware of and appreciate the risks which may result from my use of those lands and facilities. I am also aware that accidents or illness can occur during road and/or trail running and that I may be seriously injured or killed as a result.

            I am capable of participating in the Event(s). If I am aware of or under treatment for any
            physical infirmity, ailment or illness, or if I am taking any prescription or over the counter
            medications, my medical care provider knows of and has approved my participation in the Event(s). I understand, or will educate myself about, the dangers of dehydration and hyponatremia (low blood sodium) and will take precautionary measures to prevent these
            conditions. I acknowledge that I am solely responsible for my personal health and safety, and the personal property I bring with me. I also acknowledge full and sole responsibility for my own medical expenses, and I am responsible for any and all medical expenses incurred on my behalf. If I should become injured while participating in the Event(s), I authorize the Company or Event(s) organizers to secure medical assistance on my behalf and at my expense.

            I agree to abide by any rules and regulations established by Company and/or the Event(s) organizers and personnel, as well as the laws of any county, city, or other jurisdiction in which I will participate. I understand that the Company reserves the right to make changes to the terms and conditions of participation in the Event, including but not limited to changes to the Event rules and regulations, and I agree to abide by such updated terms and conditions in order to participate in the Event.

            In consideration for being permitted to participate in the Event(s), I agree to assume all

The Company is not disclaiming any liability, which by law may not be disclaimed.

            I consent to allow the Company and its licensees to use my name, photograph, image,
            voice or likeness in any media format worldwide in connection with the Event(s) and/or

I understand that weather, emergencies, or other issues
            of public safety (volcano eruptions) may cause cancellation or postponement of the Event(s). Should such cancellation or postponement occur, I understand that no contributions, payments, or expenses will be refunded by the Company and Company will reschedule the event and transfer entry fee to a new assigned date.

            I understand that, if I wish to cancel my participation 30 days PRIOR to the
